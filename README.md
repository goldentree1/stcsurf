# swell-forecast-2
 Swell forecast re-built and improved using Next.js

## Development
Use 'npx ntl dev' to start the dev server.

## Notes
- should we use .md and netlifyCMS, or use firebase/mongodb to store locations (and locationIDs)?
    option: be lazy and keep same data but find out if metocean's timestamps are accurate, and work from that.
    Does og app save ALL data, or not (ie,,is it converted THEN saved to mongodb)? What does data look like? Perhaps easiest (and double productive) to just query the DB from here.. copy from og project.
